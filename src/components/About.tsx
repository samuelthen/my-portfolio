              What gets me up in the morning isn&apos;t a love for tech slogans - it&apos;s the work itself. 
              I like hard problems, systems that break, models that don&apos;t converge, edge cases that don&apos;t behave. 
              I like understanding things properly and building things that don&apos;t fall apart.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-500">
              Whether it's tuning a model, writing a cleaner abstraction, or debugging something for hours - I enjoy the process. 
              It's not about chasing perfection, it's about getting sharper every day. That&apos;s what keeps me going.
